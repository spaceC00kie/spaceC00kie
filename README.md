### Hi there! Thanks for visiting!

I'm a developer skilled in JavaScript and TypeScript, with a passion for crafting intuitive front-end experiences using React and Tailwind CSS. I also work with Python for backend tasks and algorithms, and I'm learning Java and Spring Boot.

In addition to interacting comfortably with REST APIs, I use Postman for testing and debugging. For data caching, I employ Redis. My familiarity with Cypress aids me in software testing, while Firebase meets my cloud-hosted database needs. Striving for continuous growth, my goal is to perpetually enhance my skill base to deliver the most effective and efficient solutions possible.

Currently based in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia, I'm seeking opportunities to contribute to the software development field. My ability to work collaboratively on projects is a particular point of pride, achieved by utilizing skills honed through study and practice.

Here are some projects I created: 
- [KibbleCheck](https://github.com/spaceC00kie/has-the-dog-been-fed): A PWA with a custom rolodex component for keeping track of pet feedings, deployed on [KibbleCheck.com](https://kibblecheck.com/)
- [Keep My Plants Alive](https://github.com/spaceC00kie/keep-my-plants-alive): A full-stack system that makes it easy to monitor soil moisture levels for your indoor plants
- [Task Tracker](https://github.com/spaceC00kie/task-tracker): A to-do list and reminder software that allows users to manage their tasks and schedule reminders

I have also contributed to the following projects:
- [ChessWager](https://github.com/geektechniquestudios/ChessWager): A betting platform that uses smart contracts to securely facilitate betting on professional chess matches played on LichessTV. Transitioning the project from vanilla CSS to Tailwind CSS was one of my key roles. I was also responsible for the development of the dropdown feature, which involved porting it from JavaScript to TypeScript and incorporating animations. Inspiration for the dropdown component came from the popular YouTube coder Fireship, but I made several unique changes to the code to enhance the user experience. Recently, I executed a light mode overhaul of the entire UI.
- [Frozr](https://github.com/geektechniquestudios/Frozr): A web service that allows users to securely store their cryptocurrency in a smart contract time vault. I created a React app using Yarn, Vite, TypeScript, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS, which was then used as the starting point for the development of this project. In the project's later stages, I crafted reusable components that adhered to the creator's design standards and designed informational cards to increase the website's marketing impact.
