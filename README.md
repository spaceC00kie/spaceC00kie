### ðŸ‘‹ Let me know how I can help you!

I'm currently living in Peachtree City and providing legendary customer service in Atlanta, GA.

*You're never fully dressed without a smile!*

A human relations specialist skilled in communication and technology, I'm looking for opportunities to make meaningful contributions to the working life of those around me. I quickly become comfortable with the ins and outs of my position and I'm always eager to help others do the same.

I'm smart, sweet, and neat.
