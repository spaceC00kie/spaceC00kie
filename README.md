### Hi there! Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.

As a front-end developer, I have a strong passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing user experiences. My skills include working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and Python, and I am always eager to learn and expand my skillset further.

Currently based in Peachtree City, Georgia, I am seeking opportunities to make an impact as a developer. I am a strong communicator and pride myself on my ability to work collaboratively on projects.

Here are some of the projects I have worked on: 
- [Keep My Plants Alive](https://github.com/spaceC00kie/keep-my-plants-alive): A full-stack system that makes it easy to monitor soil moisture levels in your indoor plants
- [Task Tracker](https://github.com/spaceC00kie/task-tracker): A to-do list and reminder software that allows users to manage their tasks and set reminders for them
- [Kitty Literature API](https://github.com/spaceC00kie/kitty-literature-api): A minimal React app that displays a cat fact on a webpage

I have also contributed to the following projects:
- [ChessWager](https://github.com/geektechniquestudios/ChessWager): A betting platform that uses smart contracts to securely facilitate betting on professional chess matches played on LichessTV
- [Frozr](https://github.com/geektechniquestudios/Frozr): A web service that allows users to securely store their cryptocurrency in a smart contract time vault
